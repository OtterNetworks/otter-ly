### The problem
## Adopting new technology on tech teams is essential, but doing so remains risky, unsystematic and unpredictable.

In today’s rapidly evolving technical landscape, teams need a better method for technology adoption – one that creates immediate business value, empowers developers and controls/minimizes associated complications or risks. A lack of viable solution prevents otherwise innovative or capable companies from reaching their true value potential.

Teams tend to choose from several routes for technology adoption – all of which tend to have a low return on investment and lengthy time to MVP, among other downsides. Teams might: a) tackle the problem alone and hit insurmountable hurdles, b) hire new employees at a high cost, while forgetting about potential in existing staff, c) hire consultants who lock them into costly support services and bar them from ownership of both information and infrastructure, or d) undergo expensive supplementary skills training, after which they fail to retain newly acquired knowledge.

### Why training fails
## Teams don’t retain new skills if they can’t own and effectively apply them post-training.

Research shows that individuals retain less than 10% of what they see and hear in a lecture or demonstration after a week. In contrast, they remember 90% of what they learn when they use knowledge immediately or teach it to someone else. The process of ‘doing’ while learning allows people to build tacit knowledge through high quality social interaction and repetition. Tacit knowledge is knowledge that can’t easily be communicated through words, and because most expert knowledge falls under this category, it is an essential component within teams looking to gain a competitive advantage in developing new products and bringing them to market. 

Once teams establish their own mechanisms for tacit knowledge sharing, they are able to develop Transactive Memory Systems (TMS), or collective mental models that encompass the way knowledge is stored, shared and accessed among groups of individuals. On development teams, TMSs refer to the cooperative division of labor for learning, remembering and communicating relevant technical knowledge. 
 
The very nature of traditional training ignores this essential foundation of tacit knowledge and TMSs. Instead, training tends to perpetuate the Forgetting Curve – the principle that newly acquired knowledge is lost before it can be utilized. But why does this happen? Trainers often teach either by demonstrating themselves or instructing trainees to build a copy of a specific artifact – one that has usually has little real world value to the trainees. After the training process, the artifact gets discarded and trainees don’t interact further with it. Repetition and review of specific learned skills is not possible. The real value of training – the ownership and retention of skills in the context of a real business – is lost. Teams need to be able to train and build the very artifact that they are to use while developing an MVP.

### The solution
## The Skill Sprint is where the operators of the infrastructure build it and manage it themselves

A Skill Sprint is a one-week, cost-effective orchestrated learning experience for development teams that bridges the skills ownership gap. It typically consists of three participants: two engineers from an organization’s development team who assume the roles of ‘Driver’ and ‘Navigator’, plus a subject matter expert called a ‘Captain.’ The Captain provides specific best practices and pattern guidance while the Navigator and Drivers code and build.
 
Skill Sprints are uniquely formulated to address a team’s specific and immediate issue (e.g. infrastructure complexity), maximize existing skills of team members and drive business value by reducing technical debt. They focus on high quality social interactions to facilitate 1) tacit knowledge sharing and 2) ownership of this newly acquired knowledge, skills and any associated artifacts. They are, ultimately, a process for change that helps to manage technical risks and nurtures individuals who become agents for transformation. The end result of a Skill Sprint is an effective springboard for business evolution through the adoption of new technologies, and the team’s full ownership over both skills and infrastructure.
