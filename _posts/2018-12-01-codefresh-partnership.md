Change is afoot for development teams. With the advent of directly consumable cloud services and infrastructure such as Kubernetes, DevOps engineers no longer serve teams in the way they once did. 

Developers are now able to control and manage infrastructure using a combination of educational sprints, automated toolkits and productivity techniques to aid in efficient deployment.  

Otter Networks, whose first-ever DevOps skill sprints utilize pair programming methods to teach developers as they build flexible infrastructure, is partnering with Codefresh – the first Kubernetes-powered CI/CD platform for container delivery. The result is the first major step in a shift towards maximum autonomy and delivery capabilities for development teams. 

The two companies will host a joint webinar to discuss what’s next in the post-DevOps world. If you’re a CTO, engineer, project manager of CEO who is interested in learning about the empowered future of development teams and technologies, join in on February 7th, 2019 at 4:30 pm CET, 7:30 am PT.

Topics to be covered include:

Why DevOps engineers have been made redundant 
The rise of directly consumable cloud services and infrastructure
Otter Networks skill sprint methodology for developers 
An introduction to Productivity Engineering, and how it’s used to help reduce cognitive load as developers take on more responsibilities
Codefresh as a deployment toolkit for developers
General deployment strategies on the horizon for 2019 and beyond

Sharing their experience and breadth of knowledge will be Otter Networks founder and engineer, Andrew Holway, and Codefresh co-founder and VP Marketing Dan Garfield. 

Education and automated tools are two of the most important components of creating efficient development teams. Codefresh and Otter Networks are helping to initiate the new wave of efficient deployment.

Be sure to tune in on February 7th to learn about unlocking the full value of a modern developer’s skill set.
