## Case study: Using Kubernetes to reach development milestones

### **How a collaboration between Otter Networks and Repay.me resulted in production-ready infrastructure and upskilled developers**

[Repay.me]("https://www.repay.me/), a Berlin-based startup developing an exciting new global commerce platform, recently brought in Otter Networks to help find a solution to its ongoing development infrastructure problem.

With a major product launch approaching, Philipp – the developer responsible for management of infrastructure resources – was out of his depth trying to automate cloud resources with Ansible. The learning curves were steep, and his team lacked an overall vision. They certainly didn’t need these added challenges ahead of a mission-critical deadline.

Repay.me’s development infrastructure was becoming an unacceptable limiting factor. Not only was it difficult to manage and deploy, but it also included an array of complex microservices. The team needed a more efficient, production-ready solution in order to hit their milestone.

Repay.me CTO/CEO Sascha recognized the issue and, in partnership with Hays, bought Otter Networks in to streamline the process. Our goal in this collaboration was to make immediate decisions related to the infrastructure, and upskill the team in the process.

We ended up engaging with the team in July 2018 to rapidly deploy an out-of-the box, working solution that would help Repay.me meet their launch deadline. Working together over a one week span, we quickly migrated from Ansible and Azure to Kubernetes on Google Cloud, integrated with Jenkins for CI/CD and Github. This sprint resulted in a fully functional infrastructure with vastly improved CI/CD functionality, Review Apps and lower cloud hosting costs. Moreover, Phillipp was upskilled to manage and further engineer it. On our side, we offered continued support in case there were any hiccups down the road.

Our collaboration with Repay.me resulted in a solution with radically simpler code, fewer scripts and easier deployment. But the most empowering result is that the Repay.me developer team now fully understands, owns and maintains their infrastructure. This has helped them accelerate their production cycles, improve collaboration and significantly reduce their running costs – all in time for their product launch.
