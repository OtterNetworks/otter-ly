    The Otter Networks skill sprint was a huge success for us at a critical time. I would
    encourage teams struggling with limiting, complicated infrastructure to
    collaborate with Otter Networks in finding more efficient, long-term
    development solutions.

    It was impressive how quickly things got moving with Otter. Overall, we were
    really happy with that process.  It’s likely that we’d reengage with Otter
    Networks in the future.
