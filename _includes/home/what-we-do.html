		<h2>What we do</h2>
		<h3><strong>1. Closing the gap</strong></h3>
		<img src="/img/what_we_do_01.svg">
		<p>DevOps a can empower teams. But the engineer-based model is broken: slowly creating complex, inflexible infrastructures that lock you into your cloud provider, and are expensive to use and maintain. We call this “The DevOps Gap”.</p>
		<p><strong>We’re closing the gap.</strong></p>
		<hr></hr>
		<h3><strong>2. Design sprints</strong></h3>
		<img src="/img/what_we_do_02.svg">
		<p><strong>Design sprints to transform your infrastructure.</strong></p>
		<p>Over a 1 week design sprint, we pair with your developers to deploy a proven DevOps infrastructure solution: CI / CD system, integrated with Git and Kubernetes, and including Review Apps.</p>
		<p>We quickly upskill your team and engineer ourselves out of the process: leaving you with a powerful, flexible infrastructure which is fully understood and owned by your developers - and no ongoing reliance on a DevOps engineer.</p>
